## RecsetToCombo Function


</div>

### Description

Populating a standard combo box with data from a recordset of 15,000 records or more seems to take forever. I used API calls instead of the AddItem method and my test results shows my function is at least 3 times faster than the AddItem Method. This download does not come with a database file, so if you'd like to test it then provide your own db. Please post the number of records in your ADODB recordset object, the time it takes to populate the combo box with the Additem method (just uncomment a line in my test project, it comes with a timer), and the time it takes using my RecsetToCombo function which is made up of a couple of API calls.
